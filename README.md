Scrape documents and export to Excel

Only supports Form 4's right now

Two files:

-- init.py: Basic download and export to Excel, one-time event (probably don't use)

-- initRSS.py: Download, export, and auto-update files as soon as new insider activity occurs (as long as it is running)

Input coverage list (in tickers) and that's it
